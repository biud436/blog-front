## Installation

To start this project, you must have `Visual Studio Code` and `Node.js LTS v16` or higher installed. The node package manager uses `yarn`. `yarn berry` is faster, but `pure yarn` is used. Before starting this project, you must download the dependency node packages.

Open the integrated terminal or text editor (VS Code) and press Ctrl + ` or use the integrated terminal open feature to open the terminal at the bottom.

You can install all project dependency packages with the following command.

```bash
yarn install
```

When the above command is executed, the dependency packages will start to download. It may take several seconds or a minute or more, so please wait a moment. When the package download is complete, enter `yarn next:dev` in the terminal to start the development server.

```bash
yarn next:dev
```

This development server supports HMR (Hot Module Reload) via Webpack, so when you save the project, the browser will apply the CSS or tag (V-DOM) changes immediately.

Please open the `http://localhost:8080` in the browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This project is deployed a docker image using the GitHub Action and Github Package. The server automatically restarts using AWS CodeDeploy.
